Falisha: Part 1 of this mod was not taking so 1st 8 you generate from 9.
Sambhavi Uni: Module 1 and 2 kal karungi.
Sambhavi Uni: This and browser is still running.
Sambhavi Uni: Loading.
Sambhavi Uni: Do I need to remove framer motion from there?
Falisha: It's some frontend issue because the next.js server is running but not rendering in frontend.
Falisha: Go to the browser console and see if you're getting any errors or something.
Sambhavi Uni: What now, should I close it?
Falisha: npm uninstall framer-motion.
Sambhavi Uni: Everything is still the same.
Falisha: In terminal. First stop the server then paste this.
Sambhavi Uni: Stop sending reels nothing is happening now.
Falisha: 🤣🤣 was waiting for your reply only kid.
Falisha: You uninstalled right? After pressing Ctrl+C, you pasted that right?
Sambhavi Uni: Yeah, then ran it using dev and still browser is loading.
Falisha: Try clearing the cache or doing a hard reload (Ctrl + F5).
Sambhavi Uni: Did.
Falisha: Bro once again stop the server and type: npm install.
Falisha: It'll download all the pending dependencies.
Sambhavi Uni: Still not.
Sambhavi Uni: Bro I’m feeling our marks are gone.
Falisha: Aee shut up bro. If not, again we’ll load her project and do that’s it. Life’s easy kid.
Falisha: Soujanya's only bro. But we’ll do it from scratch like how you did now.
Sambhavi Uni: I’m tired 🥹
Falisha: Ok sammy chillax, go to bed, charge your phone. We’ll do this tomorrow in college. Good night love. Take care.
Sambhavi Uni: Should I delete everything and start again? College internet sucks.
Falisha: Sweet dreams. Yeah that’ll be good.
Sambhavi Uni: Fallu I read the 9th episode...
Falisha: 🥵😂😂🙀🤭 Send. Ask that other guy how peri got.
Sambhavi Uni: Wait I’m opening laptop. I can’t copy in this phone.
Falisha: Okok.
Sambhavi Uni: Viraj or Subhan?
Falisha: Who do you think would’ve told him? I guess also.
Sambhavi Uni: Yeah I guess so. Let me ask him.
Sambhavi Uni: You want last episode?
Falisha: Yessssssss. This one was fun.
Falisha: What did he say?
Sambhavi Uni: He only said to him. I’m asking whether he told Miss P also or not?
Falisha: Dumb he is.
Sambhavi Uni: It seems peri was there when he was reading this.
Falisha: Nice love.
Sambhavi Uni: This is really fun.
Falisha: LET'S SEE.

Sambhavi Uni: Classic Falisha 😂

Sambhavi Uni: Anyway I saved it in notepad.
Falisha: Send the last ep.
Sambhavi Uni: I have done but it’s giving very small answers.
Falisha: Ok if mine gets uploaded I’ll send up to 8.
Sambhavi Uni: But later I need to remember too na. So many times we’ve heard development and deployment that it's too much.
Falisha: Skip Ismail’s codes. Tomorrow look up diagrams on Google and draw them. It’ll look more attractive.
Sambhavi Uni: Okay fine then.
Sambhavi Uni: Bro, module 3 ke baaki wale bhej de agar hain toh.

Sambhavi Uni: I’ll ask peri once, otherwise I’ll send after reaching home.
Falisha: Theek hai bhej de. Where are you roaming? With Mr. Handsome, doctor? 🤣
Sambhavi Uni: Nahin yaar. Mr. Handsome ne jo medicine likhi hai wahi lene jaa rahi hoon.
Sambhavi Uni: Aise medicine likhi jo na CH, na SMC, na Apollo mein mil rahi hai 🥲
Sambhavi Uni: Bahut kharab traffic hai yaar.
